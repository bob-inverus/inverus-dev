# Cleanup Debug Tools

After the issue is resolved, remove these debug files:

1. Delete `app/api/debug-env/route.ts`
2. Delete `app/api/debug-supabase/route.ts`
3. Delete `app/components/debug-env-check.tsx`
4. Remove the debug component from `app/layout.tsx`:
   - Remove the import: `import { DebugEnvCheck } from "./components/debug-env-check"`
   - Remove the component: `<DebugEnvCheck />`

This will clean up the debug tools and return your app to normal operation.
